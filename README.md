# Simple-Todo-List-Privacy

## Privacy policy

This privacy policy governs your use of the software application Simple Todo List for mobile devices that was created by Joe Klakus. The Application is a simple todo list that stores todos in local storeage to be access later.

This Application does not collect precise information about the location of your mobile device. 

As an avid Android user myself, I take privacy very seriously. I know how irritating it is when apps collect your data without your knowledge.

I have not programmed this app to collect any personally identifiable information. All data (todos etc) are created by you and is stored on your device only, and can be simply erased by clearing the app's data or uninstalling it.

If you find any security vulnerability that has been inadvertently caused by me, or have any question regarding how the app protectes your privacy, please send me an email and I will surely try to fix it/help you.

If you have any questions regarding privacy while using the Application, or have questions about our practices, please contact us via email at https://jklakus.live
